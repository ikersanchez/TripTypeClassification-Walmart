Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification

Currently, Walmart's trip types are created from a combination of existing customer insights ("art") and purchase history data ("science"). In their third recruiting competition, Walmart is challenging Kagglers to focus on the (data) science and classify customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items they've purchased. Improving the science behind trip type classification will help Walmart refine their segmentation process.
